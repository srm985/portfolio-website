  - articleSectionTitle: What is an e-commerce platform?
    articleSectionBody: For those of you selling something online, you’re most
      certainly using an e-commerce platform of some sort. This may come as a
      simple out-of-the-box solution such as Wix, Squarespace, or Shopify. For
      companies pushing heavy volume, you might have turned to products such as
      Salesforce Commerce Cloud or Magento Commerce. All of these platforms have
      a core goal - to enable the sale of products or services. Apart from this
      core concept, you’ll also find handy features such as inventory management
      and insightful dashboards, serving to give you an analytical look into
      sales.
  - articleSectionTitle: What should I expect out of the box?
    articleSectionBody: Out of the box, you can expect easy-to-populate templates.
      Depending on the platform ecosystem, this select can be vast, giving you
      very granular choices. Once you’ve settled on a template, you’ll simply
      configure the website layout as applicable, and plug inventory into the
      system. With an out-of-the-box solution, you’ll typically spend more time
      entering inventory than actually standing up the site. These templates
      come pre-built with all business logic and functionality expected from a
      sales platform. They may require some coding, but it’s more focused on
      customization than development and implementation.
  - articleSectionTitle: How does a headless solution differ from a traditional
      out-of-the-box solution?
    articleSectionBody: "With a headless solution you initially receive nothing…
      While this initially may sound very suspect, there are several upsides to
      pursuing a headless solution.\r


      Before diving into the differences, let’s define “headless”.
      Headless is a term leveraged across the software development industry to
      define those implementations where traditionally you’d find a UI, but
      instead you’ll simply find the business logic and functionality abstracted
      and exposed through a set of APIs or other services. This concept has been
      around for quite a long time but has evolved into a buzzword of sorts. In
      modern web development, this concept is quite common. We typically split
      our teams into front-end and back-end developers, each with a dedicated
      role. The back-end team is tasked with implementing business logic and
      functionality and the front-end team is tasked with user interaction and
      input solicitation - providing this information to the back-end services.
      To be clear, it’s not a new technology or concept, but there are new
      competitors to the market, offering unique solutions.\r


      Speaking specifically to headless e-commerce solutions, you can
      expect all of the same functionality as seen in traditional,
      out-of-the-box solutions, but it has simply been abstracted away to back
      end services. You’re left a blank canvas with which you can create your
      wildest dreams. Your product stakeholders and designers are left with
      endless possibilities on how they might depict and represent your brand.
      No longer are you tied to a template, only halfway representative of your
      brand identity.\r\n"
  - articleSectionTitle: Why go headless, and what possibilities does it enable?
    articleSectionBody: "Pursuing a headless e-commerce platform isn’t the right
      choice for everyone. If you’re a small business, you’re selling only a few
      items, or your sales process isn’t convoluted with many interlocked steps,
      then an out-of-the-box solution most likely makes financial sense. For
      many companies, they’ll face difficulties in justifying the ROI seen from
      a headless solution. There’s a reason out-of-the-box solutions have
      captured such a large market share - they are easy to implement and they
      simply work. \r

      Two main aspects of why you might elect to migrate to a headless
      solution are brand identity and sales optimization. Regardless of sales
      volume or organizational maturity, many organizations simply do not feel
      that out-of-the-box templates represent their brand identity well. For
      companies in verticals with a large number of competitors, brand identity
      may be a strong differentiator which justifies the use of a headless
      solution and custom build. For organizations with huge sales volumes,
      optimization of the sales process through extremely granular control and
      A/B testing may allow them to tease out marginal increases. When selling
      100 units, an increase of 0.1% may not justify itself, but when selling
      orders of magnitude more, these marginal increases can easily deliver the
      ROI required to justify the custom implementation of a headless
      solution.\r

      Another major benefit is the transition to an omni-channel sales
      experience. Moving to a headless solution means your business logic is
      neatly captured in a set of APIs which may be called by any platform such
      as a mobile application, website, POS, or kiosk. This means users can
      maintain their experience across platforms and business logic changes
      efficiently reflect immediately across all platforms.\r\n"
  - articleSectionTitle: What are the risks or limitations?
    articleSectionBody: "Leveraging a headless solution is far-more complicated than
      an out of the box solution. Your development teams will be responsible for
      materializing every aspect of the user-facing solution. Out-of-the-box
      solutions have been optimized and “beta tested” through the sheer numbers
      of clients leveraging them on a day-to-day basis. You can expect an
      out-of-the-box solution to be relatively bug-free. If you’re building a
      custom solution though, you run the risk edge-condition bugs.
      Additionally, you’ll need to consider factors critical to modern web
      development such as ADA compliance or cross-browser/cross-device support.
      As with any custom development, you’ll need to thoroughly test the
      solution before rolling it out.\r


      Many of the limitations faced with a headless solution are not
      attributed to the technology itself - as it offers endless possibilities,
      but instead come down to your organizational maturity. Without key
      resources and domain-specific expertise, organizations can find a custom
      headless implementation more constrained than out-of-the-box solutions. A
      certain level of operational maturity is needed to implement such a
      solution.\r\n"
  - articleSectionTitle: What organizational maturity is required to undergo such a transformation?
    articleSectionBody: "As touched on previously, implementing a headless solution
      requires experienced technical resources. As an organization, this means
      you should already have technical teams comfortable with modern front-end
      development practices. Your teams should understand why you’re leveraging
      a headless solution. From here, you’ll need dedicated front-end developers
      because you’re going to be building a custom solution. This means you’ll
      need developers with experience in defining and maintaining
      enterprise-level solutions. They’ll need to think about aspects such as
      SEO and ADA compliance. You’ll also need a creative and UX team to ensure
      the content your developers materializing is intuitive and represents your
      brand well. You’ll need key visionaries to understand how to leverage this
      technology across platforms to deliver maximum ROI. If you don’t already
      have these resources, you should feel comfortable hiring them or turning
      to a consulting firm to complete the implementation. If your organization
      does not already have these technical resources, leveraging a consulting
      firm not only means you’re not left trying to figure out what resources
      you’ll need and how to screen and hire them, but you’ll also be able to
      forego all of the resources required to manage a project of this scale.\r


      Apart from a purely workforce standpoint, organizations should
      display a strong brand identity prior to implementation. This does not
      mean your brand must be mature, it simply means that your organization
      should thoroughly understand your brand and what it represents. As you
      will be starting with a blank canvas, it will be completely up to your
      teams to materialize a design which represents your brand well. A poor
      showing here can do more damage than good.\r\n"
  - articleSectionTitle: What indicators should I be on the lookup for to determine
      when to make the transition?
    articleSectionBody: "It’s important to keep in mind that the signs indicating a
      shift to a headless e-commerce solution is needed are many times subtle.
      Other times, the necessity may become jarringly obvious. We’ll focus on
      the subtle indicators.\r


      As your organization matures, your sales process will certainly
      mature as well. Unless you are simply selling a fixed few items, you’ll
      probably find yourself selling more items with potentially added sales
      complexity. You’ll most likely also have a growing transactional volume.
      These aspects are key contributors in justifying the conversion to a
      headless e-commerce solution. As mentioned previously, as transactional
      volume increases, even subtle changes may contribute significantly to
      conversions, and subsequently, revenue. You’ll want to make minor changes
      to your sales platform, and you’ll want to test and quantify these
      changes. Many out-of-the-box solutions offer some functionality here, but
      the more modifications you make to out-of-the-box solutions, the harder it
      becomes to maintain current versions. To truly realize full granularity, a
      headless solution will offer endless possibilities to modify and test.\r


      For those organizations with ever-increasing complexity in their
      sales process, headless solutions may be the only option. Providing users
      the ability to select the size and pattern of a shirt is simple, but as
      you add options or interlinked products, the process can become
      near-impossible for out-of-the-box solutions without major modifications.
      A headless solution empowers designers and product stakeholders to deliver
      on any vision.\r\n"
  - articleSectionTitle: Should I implement this from day one as a startup or new product?
    articleSectionBody: "For startups, it’s incredibly important to consider your
      organizational roadmap. I’ve seen many startups rush to deliver a solution
      into production, only to be plagued by technical debts, major refactors,
      and the inevitable rewrite very shortly down the road. If I could offer
      one bit of advice to startups in general - consider technical debt and how
      it affects the long run. It is easy to feel rushed or constrained based on
      budgetary restrictions, but you may be doing more harm than good in
      rushing to deliver a solution. \r


      If e-commerce is an ancillary service, or your organization is
      simply selling a few products or services, an out-of-the-box solution most
      likely makes sense. If your primary focus is e-commerce and business
      growth driven by the number of products sold and general sales volume,
      taking the leap into a headless e-commerce solution may justify itself.
      \r\n"
  - articleSectionTitle: Do I have to do this all at once?
    articleSectionBody: "For new organizations or startups then the answer most
      likely is, “Yes”. If you have no legacy code base, there’s not much of a
      business case for a partial implementation. I would recommend committing
      fully to this approach in the majority of cases where a startup has deemed
      a headless e-commerce solution justifiable. If you have an existing
      out-of-the-box e-commerce solution though, you may have some flexibility
      in slowly rolling this out - capturing high ROI areas first. \r


      Much of this incremental rollout will depend on the functionality
      provided by your existing e-commerce solution. Maintaining two e-commerce
      solutions rarely is justified. As such, if your existing solution provides
      a headless implementation and you wish to retain your current solution,
      you can simply begin the transition to the headless instance on some of
      your pages. While an incremental implementation may be feasible, the
      granularity at which this occurs may be beyond your control. The
      implementation must be strategic, and interlinked sections must transition
      at the same time to ensure coherency.\r\n"
  - articleSectionTitle: When can I start seeing benefits?
    articleSectionBody: "As with any large endeavor, projected timeline and ROI will
      be a key focus. For some organizations, the benefits may be more tangible
      than others. New organizations or startups implementing a headless
      solution may have no existing benchmarks to which they can compare. As
      such, it is certainly much more difficult to quantify your efforts. For
      these organizations, your justifications for a headless solution from the
      start should be your primary quantifiers.\r


      For existing organizations, it may be easier to gain small wins
      through an incremental implementation. Taking this approach may provide
      some immediate gratification, helping to justify further efforts. As
      you’ll want to target high ROI endeavors first, your wins should be
      immediate, but these small wins are just the first in a series of
      long-term wins.\r\n"
