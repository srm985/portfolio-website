    articleSectionBody: "Linting is controversial. Linting is the cause of many
      debates. Linting can be one of your most powerful tools, if done right. If
      you’ve spent any time in the front-end development ecosystem, you’ve most
      likely heard the word “linter” or “linting”. My definition of linting is,
      “The systematic application of preferential best practices in coding,”
      with a heavy emphasis on “preferential”. The easiest block of linting
      rules to justify are those which relate to the prevention of unexpected
      bugs through ambiguity, such as nested scope declaration of variables.
      This block of rules addresses coding techniques which teams will
      unanimously call wrong. \r

      \r

      For me, the next block of rules surrounds version control diff
      management. These rules are opinionated, but in my view, carry a bit more
      logic. For example, we might consider the notorious example of tabs versus
      spaces, carriage returns, or even trailing commas. Getting buy-in on this
      block isn’t too hard as they don’t affect the day-to-day life of
      developers. \r

      \r

      The block of rules I’m talking about today though are those rules
      which lean heavily into the preferential category. This can be something
      like destructuring versus dot notation. Whatever justification used for
      the rule can be used against the rule. The simple enforcement of these
      rules alone adds zero value to your code base. The case I’m making though
      is the value added by making the cognizant choice to define preferences
      and capture in enforced linting rules."
