projectDescription: How do you make the sales experience more personable? By
  implementing a mobile point of sale, we gave employees of one furniture chain
  the ability to sit down with customers and compose their sale on the very
  couch they were about to sell.

      In almost every category, we have all noticed a shift from
      brick-and-mortar retail to an all-encompassing digital experience. We buy
      electronics, toys for our pets, and even clothes. Digital solutions still
      come up short occasionally though. How does that couch feel when you lie
      down on it? Does that chair feel comfortable when you sit in it? We can
      read countless reviews, but sometimes we want to see the product in-person
      prior to purchasing. Coming to a retail store shouldn’t feel like an
      arduous process.

      One furniture retailer decided to try and improve upon the traditional brick-and-mortar experience by leveraging technology to deliver a more-pleasant experience to its valued customers. By developing a mobile point of sale solution, I enabled employees and customers to come together anywhere in the store to build their dream room. Instead of stepping away to a terminal to add inventory to an order, employees could keep customers engaged with a target goal streamlining the sales process.

    projectSectionTitle: Putting The Power In Employees' Hands
    projectSectionBody: Our approach to the project was simple – we wanted to help
      empower employees to easily engage customers anywhere in the showroom. The
      solution was to migrate their entire order processing and point of sale to
      their mobile devices. By serving our mobile point of sale as a progressive
      web application with the help of device support through Ionic, we gave
      employees the ability to access their entire inventory and order
      processing right from their personal devices. In addition, tablets were
      provided throughout the store for an enhanced experience. Employees simply
      logged in with their store credentials while connected to an in-store
      wireless network.

    projectSectionBody: As previously mentioned, the application was served up in
      the form of a progressive web application built out with Ionic V3. We
      selected Ionic due to its baked-in Cordova support. While we found the
      progressive web application satisfactory, we wanted to ensure we gave
      ourselves the ability to compile and execute in a WebView instance with
      hardware access. Application V2 discussions indicated the use of a barcode
      scanner, so device hardware access was critical. Our front-end team worked
      to consume RESTful endpoints served up from a PHP middleware coupled to an
      AS/400 back end.

    projectSectionTitle: Improving B2E Experience
    projectSectionBody: While the primary driving factor for developing this
      application was to bring customers, a pleasant side effect was improving
      the user experience of the legacy order processing system. Employees were
      previously stuck executing orders and searching inventory on AS/400
      terminals. Due to rigid AS/400 procedures, the client found it nearly
      impossible to update and modernize application flows. By implementing a
      stateful middleware, we enabled the ability of providing an entirely
      refreshed experience for employees. Deeply nested functionality was now a
      click away. Employees worked through orders and searched inventory in ways
      which aligned with their current business goals. User experience should be
      considered with utmost importance in any user-facing digital experience.
