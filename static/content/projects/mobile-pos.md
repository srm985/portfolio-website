projectDescription: >-
  How do you make the sales experience more personable? By implementing a mobile
  point of sale, we gave employees of one furniture chain the ability to sit
  down with customers and compose their sale on the very couch they were about
  to sell.

      In almost every category, we have all noticed a shift from
      brick-and-mortar retail to an all-encompassing digital experience. We buy
      electronics, toys for our pets, and even clothes. Digital solutions still
      come up short occasionally though. How does that couch feel when you lie
      down on it? Does that chair feel comfortable when you sit in it? We can
      read countless reviews, but sometimes we want to see the product in-person
      prior to purchasing. Coming to a retail store shouldnâ€™t feel like an
      arduous process.  

      One furniture retailer decided to try and improve upon the traditional
      brick-and-mortar experience by leveraging technology to deliver a
      more-pleasant experience to its valued customers. By developing a mobile
      point of sale solution, I enabled employees and customers to come together
      anywhere in the store to build their dream room. Instead of stepping away
      to a terminal to add inventory to an order, employees could keep customers
      engaged with a target goal streamlining the sales process.
