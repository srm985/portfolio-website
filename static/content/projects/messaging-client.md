projectDescription: >-
  This messaging client provides inmates with the opportunity to communicate in
  near-real time with their loved ones through an email client specifically
  tailored for use in prison facilities. Loved ones initiate conversations with
  inmates for a specific "mailing rate". They may then choose to provide "return
  postage" so that inmates may reply. Loved ones may send text and images, while
  inmates may only respond with text. Many restrictions are placed on this
  client due to security concerns. The repository contains the code for the two
  separate components of this messaging client - a kiosk version intended for
  use by inmates and a responsive version used by those communicating with said
  inmates.

      This messaging client consisted of three parts – which required design and
      development. It consists of a restricted kiosk application for use by
      inmates, a responsive webpage to support a broad array of devices, and
      dedicated mobile applications. The intended goal of this client was to
      provide inmates with the ability to communicate with their loved ones in
      near-real time. The client borrows many words from the world of postal
      mail. Stamps indicate available credits. These credits are sold by each
      facility and purchased by the inmates loved ones. Currently, a message may
      only be initiated by a loved one. They may send text and images to the
      inmate. If they so choose, they may provide “return postage” for the
      inmate to draft a text-only reply. The client’s limited functionality is
      related to the security measures required to ensure no illegal
      communications occur.
