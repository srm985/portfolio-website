  The goal of this project is to materialize a well-styled, onscreen keyboard
  capable of supporting numerous languages fed from .klc files generated by
  Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. This has proven to be the most-reliable
  source of unicode data along with dead keys and ligature support but I am
  willing to make revisions if a better source is found. Typical use cases for
  this application include terminals, kiosks, and other touch-point devices. I
  hope to provide the community with a valuable resource that only grows better
  with time and your support!

      At one point in my career, I found myself creating multilingual kiosk
      applications. There were plenty of jQuery keyboard plugins available, but
      none seemed to be as robust as I’d like. More importantly, why don’t any
      of them support ALL languages? I’m passionate about spoken languages and
      wanted to provide developers a way to allow them to ship their
      applications with native keyboards. 


      The concept was simple – somehow generate a list of every keyboard layout
      and write some logic to parse and display it.
