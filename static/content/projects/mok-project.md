  The goal of this project is to materialize a well-styled, onscreen keyboard
  capable of supporting numerous languages fed from .klc files generated by
  Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. This has proven to be the most-reliable
  source of unicode data along with dead keys and ligature support but I am
  willing to make revisions if a better source is found. Typical use cases for
  this application include terminals, kiosks, and other touch-point devices. I
  hope to provide the community with a valuable resource that only grows better
  with time and your support!\

      At one point in my career, I found myself creating multilingual kiosk
      applications. There were plenty of jQuery keyboard plugins available, but
      none seemed to be as robust as I’d like. More importantly, why don’t any
      of them support ALL languages? I’m passionate about spoken languages and
      wanted to provide developers a way to allow them to ship their
      applications with native keyboards. 


      The concept was simple – somehow generate a list of every keyboard layout
      and write some logic to parse and display it.

    projectSectionTitle: Why Build It?
  - projectSectionBody: >-
      Usage is quite straightforward. This project exposes a simple jQuery
      plugin which can either be directly imported into the project or served
      from a script tag pointed at the CDN,
      [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/mok-project). When
      initializing the project, users specify their desired languages. If
      they’re not found locally, the plugin simply fetches the appropriate
      version-controlled language from the CDN.


      ```html

      <script
      src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mok-project@latest/dist/main.js"></script>

      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mok-project@latest/dist/styles.css">


      <script type="text/javascript">
          $(document).ready(function() {
              $(document).keyboard({
                  language: 'us',
                  keyboardPosition: 'bottom'
              });
          });
      </script>

      ```

    projectSectionTitle: How's It Work?
  - projectSectionBody: >-
      How do you generate 99 keyboard layouts? Fortunately, I was lucky. I
      discovered I had the ability to export language flat files from a utility
      called Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. From there, I started the
      arduous process of coding the “processing engine”. This engine consisted
      of a complex regular expression along with all rules required in written
      languages. 


      At first, the concept seems simple – or at least it did to me as an
      English speaker. The user touches a key and we write that to the focused
      field. Simple enough… I quickly discovered previously-unknown words such
      as *ligature* and *deadkeys*. These required the plugin to watch for, and
      interpret, combinations of keys such as ``a + ` = à`` or `a + e = æ`.

      Despite jQuery losing popularity over the years, this keyboard has seen
      incredible growth! This keyboard has presented me with the fantastic
      opportunity of connecting with developers around the world. I’ve since
      coordinated with developers on every inhabited continent. I’ve fielded
      numerous enhancement requests and bugs. As I view the usage statistics,
      I’ve been so thrilled to see its usage with languages and layouts I never
      even knew existed!
