      When Luminantâ€™s Power Optimization Center began offering commercial
      services, no front-facing website existed. A quick Wordpress template was
      stood up and populated with basic information. No time was available
      consider information architecture and UX/UI design patterns. Consequently,
      the website only served to provide basic, unstructured information along
      with a way to contact the POC.
