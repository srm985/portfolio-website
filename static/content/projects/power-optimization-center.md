  - projectSectionBody: When Luminant’s Power Optimization Center began offering
      commercial services, no front-facing website existed. A quick WordPress
      template was stood up and populated with basic information. No time was
      available consider information architecture and UX/UI design patterns.
      Consequently, the website only served to provide basic, unstructured
      information along with a way to contact the POC.

    projectSectionTitle: Going To Market
    projectSectionBody: >-
      To bring Luminat’s service into the market, I led design and development
      efforts for the creation of a new, marketing-focused static website for
      our business unit. My end deliverable was an ADA-compliant, responsive
      website leveraging Bootstrap V3, HTML5, and SASS precompiled to CSS.
      JavaScript handled all interaction aspects and was extended by jQuery.
      During development, I focused on highly-semantic markup tags and
      well-structured page layouts to aid in indexing and effective SEO.
      Linting, testing, and build tasks were handled with Grunt. While
      developing, I also provided support and generated content for our legacy
      WordPress website. Version control was handled through Git.
